# Group Project Back End

This repo contains the `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt` you'll need to get started on your back end. A django project hasn't been created yet, so one person from the group will need to:

- clone the repo down
- create+activate a venv
- perform a `pip install` to install the modules listed in the `requirements.txt` file
- run `django-admin startproject 2024-bit-by-bit-back-end` to launch a django project
- make a commit
- push to main

Then everyone else in the group can clone the repo down and get cracking! Have a look at the "Project Setup" notes from Thinkific if you need a refresher on how to get started creating the apps you need, and feel free to reach out to mentors for help!

Don't forget to use good Git technique and co-ordinate with each other to avoid merge conflicts!
